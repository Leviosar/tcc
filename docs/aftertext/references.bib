    abstract="We present a scheme to steganographically embed information in x86 program binaries. We define sets of functionally-equivalent instructions, and use a key-derived selection process to encode information in machine code by using the appropriate instructions from each set. Such a scheme can be used to watermark (or fingerprint) code, sign executables, or simply create a covert communication channel. We experimentally measure the capacity of the covert channel by determining the distribution of equivalent instructions in several popular operating system distributions. Our analysis shows that we can embed only a limited amount of information in each executable (approximately {\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}110{\}}{\$}bit encoding rate), although this amount is sufficient for some of the potential applications mentioned. We conclude by discussing potential improvements to the capacity of the channel and other future work.",

abstract = {Malware authors make use of several techniques to obfuscate code from reverse engineering tools such as IdaPro. Typically, these techniques tend to be effective for about three to six instructions, but eventually the tools can properly disassemble the remaining code once the tool is again synchronized with the operation codes. But this loss of synchronization can be used to hide information within the instructions -- steganography. Our research explores an approach to this by presenting "Weaver", a framework for executable steganography. "Weaver" differs from other techniques in how it hides malicious instructions: the hiding instructions are prepared by generating an assembly listing of the program and finding candidate hiding locations, the steganography instructions are prepared by creating an assembly listing of the program to obtain the operation codes to be hidden, and the "weaving" process merges the two. This "weaving" attempts to place all the steganography instructions into candidate locations found in the hiding instructions.},

We then look at a number of possible approaches to the theoretical security of hidden communications. This turns out to hinge on the inefficiency of practical compression algorithms, and one of the most important parameters is whether the opponent is active or passive (i.e., whether the censor can add noise, or will merely allow or disallow a whole messages). However, there are covertexts whose compression characteristics are such that even an active opponent cannot always eliminate hidden channels completely.",

abstract = {Contrary to popular belief, the paperless office has not yet established itself. Printer forensics is therefore still an important field today to protect the reliability of printed documents or to track criminals. An important task of this is to identify the source device of a printed document. There are many forensic approaches that try to determine the source device automatically and with commercially available recording devices. However, it is difficult to find intrinsic signatures that are robust against a variety of influences of the printing process and at the same time can identify the specific source device. In most cases, the identification rate only reaches up to the printer model. For this reason we reviewed document colour tracking dots, an extrinsic signature embedded in nearly all modern colour laser printers. We developed a refined and generic extraction algorithm, found a new tracking dot pattern and decoded pattern information. Through out we propose to reuse document colour tracking dots, in combination with passive printer forensic methods. From privacy perspective we additional investigated anonymization approaches to defeat arbitrary tracking. Finally we propose our toolkitdeda which implements the entire workflow of extracting, analysing and anonymisation of a tracking dot pattern.},

abstract = {Most color laser printers manufactured and sold today add "invisible" information to make it easier to determine when a particular document was printed and exactly which printer was used. Some manufacturers have acknowledged the existence of the tracking information in their documentation while others have not. None of them have explained exactly how it works or the scope of the information that is conveyed. There are no laws or regulations that require printer companies to track printer users this way, and none that prevent them from ceasing this practice or providing customers a means to opt out of being tracked. The tracking information is coded by patterns of yellow dots that the printers add to every page they print. The details of the patterns vary by manufacturer and printer model.In this document, our team will discuss several obfuscation methods and demonstrate a successful one.Included in this document is an explanation of the firmware generated yellow dots matrix and answers to the following questions: 1. Which printers produce the dots? 2. How are the dots put on? 3. What is needed for testing? 4. What is the dot size and spacing? 5. Where are the dots located on the page? 6. How can the dots be rendered useless?},

abstract = {The Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) Project investigates an alternative to the general trend toward computers with increasingly complex instruction sets: With a proper set of instructions and a corresponding architectural design, a machine with a high effective throughput can be achieved. The simplicity of the instruction set and addressing modes allows most instructions to execute in a single machine cycle, and the simplicity of each instruction guarantees a short cycle time. In addition, such a machine should have a much shorter design time.This paper presents the architecture of RISC I and its novel hardware support scheme for procedure call/return. Overlapping sets of register banks that can pass parameters directly to subroutines are largely responsible for the excellent performance of RISC I. Static and dynamic comparisons between this new architecture and more traditional machines are given. Although instructions are simpler, the average length of programs was found not to exceed programs for DEC VAX 11 by more than a factor of 2. Preliminary benchmarks demonstrate the performance advantages of RISC. It appears possible to build a single chip computer faster than VAX 11/780.},

* There is no good technical reason not to have free, open instruction sets just as we have free, open networking standards and free, open operating systems.
<p>
* The most likely first targets for a free, open instruction set are systems on a chip for the Internet of Things, which have low cost and power demands,  and for Warehouse Scale Computers, which could benefit from viable alternatives to the 80x86 instruction set
<p>
* The best architectural style for a free, open instruction set is RISC.
<p> 
* Given the time it takes to design an instruction set, it makes more sense to adopt an existing RISC free, open instruction set than to design a new one from scratch.
<p>
* Among the existing RISC free, open instruction sets, RISC-V is the best and safest choice.}

The warden is willing to allow the prisoners to exchange messages in the hope that he can deceive at least one of them into accepting as a genuine communication from the other either a fraudulent message created by the warden himself or else a modification by him of a genuine message. However, since he has every reason to suspect that the prisoners want to coordinate an escape plan, the warden will only permit the exchanges to occur if the information contained in the messages is completely open to him -- and presumably innocuous. The prisoners, on the other hand, are willing to accept these conditions, i.e., to accept some risk of deception in order to be able to communicate at all, since they need to coordinate their plans. To do this they will have to deceive the warden by finding a way of communicating secretly in the exchanges, i.e., of establishing a ``subliminal channel'' between them in full view of the warden, even though the messages themselves contain no secret (to the warden) information{\textdaggerdbl}.
