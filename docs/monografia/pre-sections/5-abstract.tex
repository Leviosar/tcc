\begin{abstract}
  At a time when technology evolves so quickly, new vulnerabilities in web applications are found every month while others are remedied, this means that the state of the art of computer security is constantly updated. In this context, this work proposes to develop an environment for learning and practicing offensive security techniques in web applications with high-risk vulnerabilities in recent years.
